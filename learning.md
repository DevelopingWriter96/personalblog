### Research and Learning

## Searching for answers
Everyone needs to do research at one point or another in their chosen field, web development is definitely no exception. While different sources often bring different results, I personally use the teachers materials first in a class based scenario, then I turn to my friend Google, this is particularly shown when research for curiousity's sake or for writing a book (I don't think I'm on a watchlist yet ;)). Knowing when to use quotation marks, what and does and using a minus sign to filter results has worked wonders on all the search engines I've been on. 

## Stuck in a Rut
However, too much ineffective learning can be extremely detrimental, as it can lead to what is known as "tutorial hell" (pardon the tongue, but thats its name). If understand it correctly, this phenomena can be best described as spinning your wheels with tutorials, watch tutorial after tutorial, not actually applying what you learn. This is detrimental because unless you practice on your, own you're not really going to learn anything. So if you need to, put it down and give it a go, keep at it until you get it right, then you can go back to the tutorials, if you need them anymore!

## Learning in my own way
Learning, like teaching is not one size fits all, and I'm no different. Personally, when I learn coding, I tend to learn best and listen better by keeping my hands busy and therefore engaging more than one sense while I try to understand what the teacher is saying. Sketchnoting also helps me grasp in a similar concept if I have paper nearby. However, I best learn by actually doing myself, mimicing the techniques taught. I would also recommend practice. That's how you get better at a language, and coding is no exception.
