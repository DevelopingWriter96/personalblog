### Phase 1: Simple Data

## This is "The Way I SMITE"

SMITE is a popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena that I recently got into myself, however as with all MOBAS there is a fair amount of strategy and pre-planning needed. I designed this app to help with that as it will allow players to store and favorite owned skins, voicepacks, and emotes. Along with that, it will allow them to use in game items to customize their strategies also known as "building". This will allow them to plan for their next matches on their mobile before they even enter the Queque.

## So... many... gods...

For this project, I tried to keep it simple yet sortable with only starting with a few pantheons, namely Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Norse. However, there was a lot more to unpack as each God needed to be given a number for the initial alphabetical array, a favorite status, a class (or style, in the code), and an owned status. So the first thing I did was after writing it all down on notebook paper, recording their class and pantheon, I then put it all into an array... which turned out longer than I had ever imagined.

## Database wanted?

Realizing that this is just the beginning of the things that need to be done with this app, part of me wondered if I took the wrong approach, perhaps putting it all in a database first might be a more efficient way of storing literally over 50 unique objects with their properties. Next week, this is exactly what I will look into.
