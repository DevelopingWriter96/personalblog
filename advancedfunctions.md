### Advanced Functions

## What are Recursive Functions? 
//function functionName {
    functionName();
}

Functions tend to be more flexible than we think, as they can do almost anything. One of the examples of this is recursive functions, or functions that call themselves. This works because it lets you change the fucntion while its running, creating countdowns, loops, etc. And of course opening the door to more possibilities with the code. However, there are a few things to keep in mind such as not all variables will be considered depending on their placement. 

## What are Scopes and Closures?
//Function functionName {
  var varName:example1;
}
//var varName2:example2;

A Closure is quite simply when a function closes and determines the Scope closes. Scope is important because scope determines what variables and objects you can use. Keeping this in mind actually helps with recursive functions as well as regular functions. But keep in mind that the Scope is determined by where the closure is. As when the function closes, so does the scope.

## What are Spread Operators?
//example.max(...[1,2,3]) // 4;

A spread operator is a type of expander in Javascript that uses the syntax "..." before an array or string. Spreading an array is actually really helpful as it can do multiple things such as copy and compansate Arrays. Running math is also a way it can be and is used, such as finding the minimum or maximum. Arrays can also be used as arguements with the assistance of Spread operators. And the list goes on, Spread operators are incredible for modifying arrays and strings as needed to further your code.
