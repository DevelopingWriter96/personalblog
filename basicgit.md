### Git it together

## What is Git?
Git is a way to store changes through snapshots and commits. This allows you to track your work and changes as you alter the code and continually update a repository which will store all versions of your code. This makes it easier to track and make changes. 

## What is Github?
Github seems to be a repostiory that uses Git to store files. This makes them easy to access as you work on projects as well as easy to share projects with groups or fellow peers or employers.

## What is the difference?
Github is an online repository that git commits can be pushed to for storage. Git itself is used for making the commits, it seems to be technology versus platform to some degree based on what I understand about it.
