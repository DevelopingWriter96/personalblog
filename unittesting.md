### Unit Testing

## What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing appears to be testing code in little snippets. This seems to be important as it means you can find a problem early. Based on my knowledge you can use it with just about any programming language. It also allows changes to quickly be made, while documenting them well. To be honest, part of me is wondering why I was not taught it sooner.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test Driven Development is when you test and develop at the same time as you make a program. This allows for problems to be solved as they arise. It connects with Unit testing as the problem in a unit is found as it is programmed. However, it slows down the process although it could be more efficient as problems are found sooner. So whether or not is better depends on the program you are developing and what is required by your client.

## What is a Unit?
A unit is a small piece of code and the namesake of Unit testing. It can be any small part that is part of a larger program, a function, a class, just about anything. As long as it is a piece of a larger project.
