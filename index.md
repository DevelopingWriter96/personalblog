### Welcome to the Blog of Richard Stacey! The Developing Writer!

## Who am I?
My full name is Richard Mark Stacey and after my full time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I have returned to Utah Valley University and recently aqquired my associates degree and am working on my Bachelor's. I consider myself to be a decent Web Developer and Designer, but I have a lot to learn and intend to keep moving forward in this degree. My username comes from the fact that I also enjoy creative Writing, alongside Dnd, Legos, and Video Games, it is one of my hobbies. As for family, I come from a Family of five with 2 siblings. An older and a younger sister. I am a fantasy, Marvel, and Disney Nerd and find fascination in these topics.

## Javascript Juvenile
Though biologically I am 23 years old, I am a bit of a child when it comes to Javascript, as I am not only rusty from a long hiatus, but only pretty much only know the basics. That being said, I am ready and willing to learn more.

## The Best Part
I'm a very creative person, so seeing it all come together is my favorite part especially on a project I am passionate about. Sometimes thats all it takes for me not to throw in the towel when the path gets hard.

## A Work in Progress
I realize now that I'm going to be learning all my life in this field. But nonetheless, I hope to build a bit of a Web Dev. tool belt and add to it as needed so as to stay on top of the curve as technology continues to grow and evolve.
