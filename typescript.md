### Typescript

## What is Typescript
Typescript is a programming language that builds on top of Javascript, creating a similar yet different language. Unlike react is not a library and language in itself, maintained by Microsoft. It also introduces static types in coding. Its so similar to Javascript that the code is the same, but the typescript turns it into Typescript code.

## Typescript as a Tool
As Typescript builds from Javascript, it can do everything Javascript can and more. The key seems to be the compiler which compiles the javascript into typescript. Typescript allows you to create and destory types making the code more exact. With this in mind, though its a coding language unto itself, it seems to be more of an addon than a stand-alone language.

## Compilation vs. transpilation
I suppose looking into it, typescript tends to transpile rather than compile as transpile takes the code and makes it into a new language.
