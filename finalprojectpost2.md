### Phase 2: Into the Database

## "Making a SQL"

After this was all the Gods were recorded, a database was then needed and I went with SQL for this due to its simplicity. So after installing the proper software, I found out the hard way how hard it could actually be as I installed the manager before I even had SQL installed on my computer, whoops! Then there was when I had to redo the tables for this. After that though with a small bit of frustration due to the ordering hiccups that come with fixing mistakes in the datatable with automatic numbering. Other than that is mostly went smoothly, until about 30 entries in.

## Into the Dataverse

I learned very quickly it might have been better to start with a database rather than array because now I'm typing the same data in a different format and like last time, its a bit of a long haul. When I first tried to make this database, I thought there would be a way to convert the pre-existing array into a database. Boy, how I was wrong or at least if there was a way, I couldn't find it. To say nothing that at least at first, a database was not easy to be commited onto my github account. So yeah, this was an adventure.

## The Missing Link

However, I also have learned when it comes to storing big data, a database is easily the way to go and should definitely be considered rather than an array in this case especially if the app wants to expand to more Pantheons other than the ones I chose for this year's iteration. That being said, the database will be useless if I cannot access it from my code, therefore, my next step is to link it to the code so that the data can be used for variables.
