### NPM

## What is NPM
NPM or Node Package Manager is a Package manager that helps condense and send Javascript Packages. It also holds the title of the world's largest software registry. So essentially, it allows people to make, store, and download software with relative ease. Personally, I have used it but mostly via installation, but has it been useful? You bet it has. 

## Why use NPM?
When it comes to managing software itself and different aspects such as software dependencies, npm can do that and more. As show with when I used it, it can both install and create software. However, in order to do so, you need to put it into a format that npm can process, namely modules. Once its packaged in this way, the full benefits of npm can be used.

## Components of NPM
NPM packages is made of 3 components, package.json which helps specify what the file does, CLI which is the client for the npm and the nodes themselves.
