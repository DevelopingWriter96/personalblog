### Functions, Arrays, and Objects

## What is a Function
//function functionName {//example}

Javascript at its base is a programming language and therefore needs to run programs Functions are essentially the blocks of code that tell which programs to run. This can include loops, equations or other things as needed. Whats nice about this is that there is such a thing as callback functions which can be programmed to be called at a later time. If the values of the function aren't known, then a promise can be called to fill in the blanks. 

## Introduction to Objects
//object:example;
When more than one value needs to be stored in an variable. An Object is a great way to do so. Putting an object in a for loop or an if then loop will allow you to deal with multiple values or variables at once in the chosen string. This helps you organize your code and makes it so you are not typing for who knows how long. Which will save a lot of time and make the code itself more efficient.

## What are Arrays?
//var array["1","2","3","4"];
An Array is a lot like a javascript list, except the values are more easily changable. For instance, you can delete, add, and retrieve values, to an array using various tags such as pop, push, and others. Like most code, it can be used with loops as well which actually makes it easier to type out the array as the program will do most of it for you. As usual, it uses for and if then loops both of which have their merits and uses depending on the array and will hopefully be covered more in depth at a later day.
