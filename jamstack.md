### Experiences and lessons with Jamstack

## What is Jamstack
As a part of its nature, technology is always evolving and changing. When I first started my Web Development journey, it was required to have a server just to host a single page site. Now, with Jamstack, that is no longer a concrete requirement. Jamstack is a unique mix of Javascript, Api, and web markup to help create more pages quickly and efficiently that can keep up with current standards. It's not a new language but I would rather call it a framework, somewhat similar to json or bootstrap.

## A New tool, a New Toy
As previously mentioned, there is no longer a need to use a single server. Git is also heavily implemented, so there's no need to locally run the code and waste precious hard drive space. It also uses some of the best stuff on the market in terms of tech, so developers will have no problem making their sites look modern and high tech and also have them be so. Also, as there are many different ways to implement Jamstack, it can be customized to fit the basic needs of the developer. The automation of the whole process aguments rather than impeeds the building process making thte site better for it.

## Have I used it before?
Well, the short answer is yes. This site runs using a type of Jamstack, Jeykll to be precise. The reason why is because I used github pages to get this site live. Github pages uses Jekyll and therefore Jamstack. I also used a condensed version of markup to code it.
