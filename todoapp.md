### Learning Through Failure: The Todo App that made me sweat

## How does it work
It works by using a function to draw from an array in the Javascript and applying it to the html. The delete uses a removeChild function. And the toggle uses a Style= "none" or Style = "block" Switch. All with a healthy amount of loops. Its crude, but it works. The CSS is simply used to make it easier to view on mobiles and tablets as well as desktops but was applied to the project quickly so as to primarily focus on the Javascript.

## Speedbumps and Bugs
This was arguably my most difficult project I'd ever done and it was made even harder due to mis-managed deadlines and a Currently shaky foundation in Javascript. As well as this, I had to get a lot of help to get the remove and toggle functions working properly as well as a lot of research on my own, arguably the hardest thing for me was the toggle especially because I didn't really understand why my other delete function was not working as anticipated. However, it all got mostly working in the end, but had I allowed myself more time, and resources, It would have been better. 

## Keep Moving Forward
And so, that's exactly what I intend to do. Javascript might be used by computers and programmers, but at its base, its just another language and will come back with practice. And so that's what I'm going to do. As well as give myself more time and use more advanced techniques. To every programming problem there is a solution, and every simple solution has one that is simpler, I just need to learn the right code. And keep going, no matter what.
